# TXP Spread.ly

This plugins shows a like/deal button for the Spread.ly service.

The instructions are very easy and you just to put a tag into the desired form or page in your Textpattern installation. The tag is &lt;txp:spreadly/&gt; and it accepts some optional parameters:

* _url_: the URL to like/deal. If you don't use this parameter, the current article URL will be send by default.
* _social_: the "social" parameter decides if there are profile images of your friends below the button (only if your friends have liked this URL before).
* _title_: the title of the sent page. The article title is sent by default.
* _description_: a short summary.
* _photo_: URL of an image from your post.
